This is a collection of folders with python programs inside them.
These python programs represent work that I did for my introductory
course for Launch School's python program. Most of the folders are
named for a chapter I needed to create the program for to complete
all exercises.

the waterloo_exercises folder is just 2 programs I originally added
to the repository as I was doing another course Launch School
pointed me to. In hind sight I wish I had saved other programs
from the waterloo course, but they're lost now.
